You can also check out the TypeScript & vanilla JavaScript implementation on the typescript-build and vanilla-build branches respectively.

## Features

- Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React and TypeScript.
- Persistent game state using `localStorage`.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Clear visual indicators for player turns and game status.

## Learnings

During this project, I learned and applied several key concepts and technologies:

- **TypeScript**: Leveraged TypeScript to add static typing to the project, ensuring better code quality and maintainability.
- **React**: Developed a deeper understanding of React, including component-based architecture, state management, and hooks.
  - **useState**: Managed state within functional components.
  - **useEffect**: Handled side effects such as updating `localStorage` and syncing game state across tabs.
- **Non-Mutating Code**: Ensured state immutability for reliable state updates and predictable rendering.
- **Project Setup**: Used `bun` to initialize the project, which streamlined the setup process and optimized performance.
